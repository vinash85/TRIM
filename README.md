## Description 

Abnormal energy metabolism is a common theme for immune evasion in tumors. Targeting cancer energy metabolism can reinvigorate tumor immunity. Focusing on energy metabolism by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), TRIM identifes transcriptional regulator of immune-metabolism. In particular, TRIM analyzes 21,000 ChIP-seq experiments, and then determined their immune-modulatory potential in 11,000 tumors and 160,000 single-cells from cancer patients. 

Once a immune-metabollic regulator is identified, TRIM can evaluate immuno-modulatory effects of its targeting on cell lines, CRISPR knockout, bulk RNA-seq, immunotherapy response, and in single cell data. We are currently following up several top immune-metabolic regulators by in vitro and in vivo experiments.
